myproj(7)
=========

NAME
----
myproj - a protocol framework for ZeroMQ.

SYNOPSIS
--------

myproj is two things. First, a code generator capable of producing fast
and efficient binary codecs for ZeroMQ-based protocols. Second, a base
project for your ZeroMQ C protocol clients and servers.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

To use myproj, clone the repository at https://github.com/zeromq/myproj.

Build and test using the usual commands:
----
./autogen.sh
./configure
make check
----

And then install the code generator:
----
make install
----

Next, read the model/myproj_msg.xml file to learn how to write your
own protocol specifications. The binary codec has the same name, and is
src/myproj_msg.c and include/myproj_msg.h.

To rebuild the codec, first build and install https://github.com/imatix/gsl.
Then run these commands:
----
cd generate
./generate
cd ..
make check
----

Finally, to use myproj as the base for your own projects, clone the git
repository, then:
----
rm .git
rm model
git init .
----

And then manually change all references to 'myproj' to your own project
prefix, both in filenames, and inside the sources. We may script this, later.
